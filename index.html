Hi my name is Anton and I will review your code and give you some advice on it

1. So first thing I have noticed is that you dont have a viewport meta tag, it always a good practice to have one to ensure that you website looks good on all screen sizes

2. Instead of creating both h1 and h2 tags like you did <h1>Generate a</h1> <h2>random password</h2> I would create just one h1 tag and put "random password" text inside a span tag that will be inside that h1 tag. Then if you want it to have a different styling just create descriptive class for it and style it

3. You have small formating issues inside a button tag

4. I think for a simple events like clicks there is a better way to use addEventListener method inside your JS instead of the onclick attribute

5. And the last one I think you should display generated passwords inside a div tag instead of h5 for a better semantic layout

The rest is perfect. Great job!
